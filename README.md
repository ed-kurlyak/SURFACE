# SURFACE Example (WinAPI Port)

This is a Windows API (WinAPI) version of the classic **SURFACE** application, built using **Visual Studio 2019** in C++.

## Background

The original version of this example was provided in the book  
**"Turbo Pascal z grafiką dla IMB PC"**  
(*Turbo Pascal with Graphics for Personal Computers*)  
by Polish author **Jan Bielecki**, published in **Poland in 1988**, and later translated and published in Russian by the **"Mashinostroenie"** publishing house in **1991**.

The original SURFACE example in book was written in **Turbo Pascal** and demonstrated basic 3D surface plotting using a wireframe rendering method.

## About This Version

This version is a **C++ port** of the original SURFACE example from book, implemented using **pure WinAPI**, with no third-party libraries.

The structure and logic of the code have been faithfully preserved to match the original example shown in the book — only translated to C++.

## How to Build

1. Open the solution in **Visual Studio 2019**.
2. Build the project using your preferred configuration (Debug/Release).
3. Run the compiled `.exe` to see the wireframe surface rendering.
